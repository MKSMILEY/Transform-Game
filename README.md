# Transform-Game
Source Code for my Unreal Engine Game Transform

Transform is a game I made for the Summer Game Jam 2020. The theme was "change" so I created a game that involved precise platforming while changing between three different "forms." Form 1 is "Jump" and it is the tallest, highest jumping form with in air control. Form 2 is "Run" and it is shorter but can move at a much faster pace. Form 3 is "Glide" and it is the shortest, but you can hold the space key to glide with a lot of in air control.

The game features four levels, one focused on each form, and then a fourth level requiring you to cahnge on the fly between the forms in order to complete it.
